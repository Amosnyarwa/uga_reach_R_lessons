## Basic steps for spatial Verification

- Download data from Kobo
- Extract a subset data of a day of interest
- Add the extracted data to a map
- Add the sample points to the same map
- Calculate the distances btn collected points and sampled points
- Highlight points that are at a greater distnce(>150m)
- Create output map
